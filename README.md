# MachineLearning101

Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves.
The name Machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel.

Popular Languages for ML: Python / also available in Swift or iOS (Core ML)

# What can machine learning do for you?
Mobile phones and tablets are now powerful enough to take advantage of the awesome opportunities offered by machine learning and artificial intelligence.

Here are some of the things your app can do with machine learning:

COMPUTER VISION
- detect objects, faces & landmarks on photos, videos, or live camera
- recognize handwriting and printed text within images
- search using pictures
- track motion and poses
- recognize gestures
- understand emotional cues in photos and videos
- enhance images and remove imperfections
- automatically tag and categorize visual content
- add special effects and filters
- detect explicit content
- create 3D models of interior spaces
- augmented reality

NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING
- extract meaning from text
- chatbots and conversational UI
- translate text into other languages
- intelligent spelling correction
- summarize texts
- detect topics and sentiment

SPEECH AND AUDIO
- speech recognition and synthesis
- translate speech in real-time
- automatic subtitling of videos
- recommend music based on your mood or surroundings
- intelligently filtering audio
- sound / music recognition
- language or dialect detection
- identify speakers by voice

And much more… There’s no limit to what’s possible when you combine the raw power of deep learning with the phone’s camera and its many other sensors.

Deep learning turns your mobile into a truly smart assistant.
